This is a problem with your remote. When you do git push origin master, origin is the remote and master is the branch you're pushing.

When you do this:

git remote

I bet the list does not include origin. To re-add the origin remote:

git remote add origin git@github.com:your_github_username/your_github_app.git

Or, if it exists but is formatted incorrectly:

git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:your_github_username/your_github_app.git
